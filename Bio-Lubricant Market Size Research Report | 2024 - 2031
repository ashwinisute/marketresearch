Market Analysis and Insights

Bio-Lubricant Market

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the bio-lubricant market will witness a CAGR of 6.10% for the forecast period of 2022-2029. Growth in the demand for bio lubricants especially in the emerging economies such as India and China, growing use of bio lubricants by a wide range of end user verticals such as power generation, food and beverages, chemical manufacturing, and other end-user industries, and surge in industrialization especially in the developing countries are the major factors attributable to the growth of the bio-lubricant market.

Bio-lubricants are the lubricants that are manufactured using biological ingredients such as sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, animal fats, and others. Bio-lubricants are manufactured by chemical modification of plant-based oils and therefore, are non-toxic, eco-friendly, bio-degradable and renewable in nature.

Rise in demand for bio-lubricant by automotive and transportation industry is the root cause for fuelling up the market growth rate. Rising demand for bio-lubricant in the metallurgy and metal working applications and growth and expansion of various end user verticals in the emerging economies will also directly and positively impact the growth rate of the market. Rising awareness about the benefits of bio-lubricant in comparison to other lubricants or alternatives, rising expenditure for research and development proficiencies by the major companies, upsurge in the rate of industrialization, stringent regulations imposed by the government on the application of synthetic lubricants, environmental concerns and growing focus on the technological advancements and modernization in the production techniques will further carve the way for the growth of the market.

However, insufficiency in raw material demand and supply owing to the lockdown and volatility in their prices will pose a major challenge to the growth of the market. High cost associated with research and development proficiencies, and strict global trade restrictions will dampen the market growth rate. Also, stringent government rules and regulations pertaining to the application of conventional lubricants will also hamper the market growth rate. High production cost of bio-lubricants and large scale availability of low cost alternatives in the market will also restrict the scope of growth.
